# NoHow

NoHow is a terminal-based learning tool designed to help you understand books, courses, or any structured knowledge faster and deeper.

NoHow turns a book’s table of contents into an interactive learning assistant, where each chapter becomes its own focused AI-powered conversation.

## What Problem Does NoHow Solve?

When learning from books or long resources, you often face problems like:

- Chapters are dense and slow to read
- You forget context when switching topics
- You want explanations, not just summaries
- You want to ask your questions, at your pace

NoHow fixes this by letting you:

- Define a book’s structure once
- Generate explanations chapter by chapter
- Ask unlimited questions, always grounded in the current chapter

## Usage Example

Suppose you want to learn Python and you start by defining a table of contents.

You could copy-paste something like this into NoHow:

```
# Python in a Nutshell

## Basics
### Running Python and understanding indentation.
### Variables, numbers, strings, and collections.

## Control Flow
### if statements and loops.

## Functions
### Defining, calling, and returning values.

## Modules
### Importing code and using the standard library.

## Strings and Dates
### Formatting text and handling time.

## Errors
### Exceptions and basic debugging.

## Pythonic Style
### Comprehensions and readable code.

## Objects
### Classes and simple object-oriented design.
```

Once imported into NoHow:

- Navigate the chapter tree
  - Select any chapter or subchapter
  - The breadcrumb shows where you are
- Automatic chapter generation
  - The first time you open a subchapter, NoHow generates a clear explanation for it
- Ask anything
  - Questions stay scoped to the current chapter
  - Examples:
    - "Why is indentation important in Python?"
    - "Can you show a simple loop example?"
    - "What mistakes should beginners avoid here?"

- Learn incrementally
  - Each chapter has its own focused conversation
  - No context pollution from other chapters


## Philosophy

NoHow is not about replacing books.

It’s about:

- Making books interactive
- Turning passive reading into active understanding
- Helping you go from “I read this” to “I know how this works”
